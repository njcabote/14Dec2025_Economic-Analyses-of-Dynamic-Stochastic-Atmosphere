Table 6. Distribution of net revenue differences (DCA − CA) from Monte Carlo simulation, showing median outcomes and uncertainty ranges by cultivar, orchard location, and peak period.
Cultivar/Orchard	Peak Month i	Median Revenue Diff	P10 Revenue Diff ii	P90 Revenue Diff iii	Prob Positive Diff iv
Gala Orchard 1	May 2022	-$2,692	-$130,708	$43,161	29%
	May 2023	-$807	-$3,306	$31,903	42%
	May 2024	$3,504	-$3,085	$451,724	58%
Honeycrisp Orchard 1 	July 2022	-$1,144,144	-$2,106,270	-$306,694	3%
	July 2023	-$3,238	-$80,849	-$779	4%
	July 2024	-$2,260	-$80,464	$78,212	34%
Honeycrisp Orchard 2 	July 2022	$245,563	-$492,662	$363,055	77%
	July 2023	$199,263	-$245,754	$419,367	78%
	July 2024	-$327,987	-$608,406	-$90,767	3%
Notes: DCA = Dynamic controlled atmosphere; CA = Controlled atmosphere
i Peak periods represent months with highest predicted market prices: May for Gala and July for Honeycrisp.
ii, iii P10 and P90 percentiles show the 10th (lowest 10 percent) and 90th (highest 10 percent) percentile from 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, representing uncertainty range.
iv Positive probability indicates the percentage of scenarios where DCA generates higher net revenue compared to CA.
