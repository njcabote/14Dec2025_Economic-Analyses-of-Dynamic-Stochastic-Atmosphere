i Storage seasons when Dynamic Controlled Atmosphere (DCA) shows meaningful economic advantages. Spring (March-May) represents the transition period when DCA advantages begin to emerge as storage extends beyond 6 months. Summer (June-August) represents the peak period for DCA economic advantage, when extended storage (7-9 months) maximizes the technology's quality preservation benefits and coincides with higher seasonal prices.
ii Percentage chance that DCA outperforms Controlled Atmosphere (CA) storage in revenue generation
iii Median additional net revenue per room when using DCA instead of CA storage
