Note: IQR is the Interquartile range which represents the range between the 25th and 75th percentiles of marketable fruit percentages from Monte Carlo simulations. The range contains 50% of simulation outcomes (25th-75th percentiles), indicating variability around the mean of marketable fruit percentage.
